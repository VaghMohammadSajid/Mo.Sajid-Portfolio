                                    <p>My educational journey has played a foundational role in shaping my technical
                                        mindset, problem-solving ability, and passion for software development. I
                                        completed my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) in Information Technology
                                        from Sheliya Jafari BCA College, Sedrana, graduating with a strong academic
                                        performance of 8.44 CGPA, which reflects my consistency, discipline, and
                                        commitment to learning throughout the program. During my studies, I gained a
                                        solid understanding of core computer science subjects such as programming
                                        fundamentals, data structures, database management systems, operating systems,
                                        computer networks, software engineering, and web technologies. These subjects
                                        strengthened my logical thinking and analytical skills, enabling me to approach
                                        problems systematically and design efficient solutions. From the early
                                        semesters, I developed a strong interest in programming and software
                                        development, particularly in understanding how applications function internally
                                        and how data flows across different layers of a system.</p>

                                    <p>As part of my academic curriculum, I worked extensively with programming
                                        languages including C, C++, Java, and Python, which helped me understand
                                        different programming paradigms such as procedural, object-oriented, and modular
                                        programming. Over time, Python became my preferred language due to its
                                        simplicity, readability, and powerful ecosystem, motivating me to explore it
                                        beyond the syllabus. My education in database technologies using MySQL and
                                        Oracle SQL provided me with a strong understanding of relational database
                                        design, normalization, complex queries, indexing, and transaction handling. Web
                                        development subjects introduced me to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side
                                        technologies, which sparked my interest in building complete, functional web
                                        applications rather than isolated programs. Practical labs, assignments, and
                                        mini projects played a key role in reinforcing theoretical concepts through
                                        hands-on implementation.</p>
                                    <p>In the later stages of my degree, I focused more deeply on backend development,
                                        particularly using Python frameworks such as Django, where I learned to build
                                        secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications following the MVC/MVT
                                        architectural patterns. My academic projects involved implementing essential
                                        features such as user authentication, database integration, RESTful APIs,
                                        pagination, filtering, file uploads, and role-based access control. I also
                                        gained exposure to Django REST Framework and FastAPI, which enhanced my
                                        understanding of API development and modern backend systems. Through these
                                        projects, I learned to write clean, optimized, and reusable code while handling
                                        real-world challenges such as debugging, performance optimization, and data
                                        validation.</p>
                                    <p>Alongside technical skills, my educational experience helped me develop essential
                                        soft skills such as teamwork, communication, time management, and adaptability,
                                        as many projects required collaboration, documentation, and presentations. I
                                        learned how to analyze requirements, break down complex problems into manageable
                                        tasks, and continuously improve my work based on feedback. My BCA education
                                        provided me with a strong academic foundation, practical exposure, and the
                                        confidence to pursue a professional career in software development, particularly
                                        as a Python Django backend developer. It also instilled in me a mindset of
                                        continuous learning and curiosity, which I continue to apply as I enhance my
                                        skills, explore new technologies, and work toward building impactful, real-world
                                        software solutions.</p>

                                    <p>My professional knowledge and experience have been shaped through hands-on work
                                        as a software developer at StackerBee Technology, Dwarka, Delhi, where I gained
                                        practical exposure to real-world application development and backend
                                        engineering. With approximately 11 months of professional experience, I worked
                                        primarily as a Python Django backend developer, contributing to the design,
                                        development, and maintenance of scalable web applications. This role allowed me
                                        to apply my academic foundation to live projects, understand business
                                        requirements, and deliver backend solutions aligned with client and
                                        organizational needs. I became familiar with professional development workflows,
                                        including requirement analysis, sprint-based task execution, debugging, testing,
                                        and deployment support. Working in a company environment helped me understand
                                        the importance of writing clean, maintainable code, following best practices,
                                        and building systems that are both reliable and scalable.</p>
                                    <p>During my time at StackerBee Technology, I worked extensively with the Django
                                        framework, where I developed backend logic, database-driven features, and secure
                                        authentication systems. My responsibilities included implementing CRUD
                                        operations, user role and permission management, pagination, advanced filtering,
                                        search functionality, file uploads, and email notifications. I also worked with
                                        Django REST Framework (DRF) to build RESTful APIs used by web and mobile
                                        applications, focusing on serializers, views, permissions, request validation,
                                        and error handling. Through continuous interaction with databases such as
                                        PostgreSQL and MySQL, I gained strong experience in schema design, query
                                        optimization, data integrity, and performance tuning. This hands-on exposure
                                        strengthened my understanding of how backend systems manage large datasets
                                        efficiently while ensuring security and reliability.</p>
                                    <p>In addition to Django-based development, I gained practical experience with
                                        FastAPI, where I worked on building high-performance and lightweight APIs with a
                                        focus on speed, scalability, and clean architecture. I also worked on projects
                                        involving Django Oscar, where I customized e-commerce workflows, reports,
                                        middleware behavior, and pagination logic according to specific business
                                        requirements. These projects helped me understand how to work with large and
                                        existing codebases, extend third-party frameworks, and solve complex backend
                                        issues in production-like environments. Alongside my core backend
                                        responsibilities, I have developed a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence
                                        and Machine Learning, particularly in exploring how AI-driven features can be

                                        long-term goal of building intelligent, data-driven applications that combine
                                        scalable backend architectures with smart decision-making capabilities.</p>
                                    <p>Beyond technical development, my experience at StackerBee Technology helped me
                                        grow professionally in terms of communication, teamwork, accountability, and
                                        adaptability. I collaborated closely with frontend developers, designers, and
                                        project managers to ensure smooth integration between backend services and
                                        user-facing interfaces. I learned how to manage tasks efficiently, meet
                                        deadlines, handle feedback constructively, and adapt to changing project
                                        requirements. This professional journey has shaped me into a disciplined and
                                        detail-oriented backend developer with strong problem-solving skills and a
                                        continuous learning mindset. Overall, my knowledge and experience reflect a
                                        strong foundation in Python, Django, REST APIs, and backend system design,
                                        combined with a forward-looking interest in AI and Machine Learning. I am
                                        committed to enhancing my technical expertise, learning emerging technologies,
